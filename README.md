# The Clipboard Drive-Thru

This is an app intended to enable fast and simple file transfers between devices.

## How to use: 
* Open the app on both devices
* Enter a pairing code
* Copy your desired text on one device to your clipboard
* Click "paste to server"
* On the other device, click "Copy from server"
The text from the first device has now been copied to the second device.

## We used:
* Express JS server with WebSockets for the backend
* Flutter for the mobile client
* Electron for the desktop client
